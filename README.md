# Memorize Me
"Shoot I need to memorize the speech by tomorrow". We can all agree that we've all said something to this effect before and as of right now the quick solution is to sit down and just memorize what needs to be said. But I propose a solution using the alexa platform. 

#Description
Memorize Me is an app which reads some text over and over again, to aid with memorization. In this respect Alexa makes a fantastic companion to help memorize some lines. By being able to hear your lines over and over again with nowork you can easily get up to speed with what you need to know.
